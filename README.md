# Product Strategy Case Study – Otter.ai (AI Meeting Intelligence)

## Project Overview
This project is a product strategy case study focused on **Otter.ai**, an AI-powered meeting assistant. The goal was to design a feature and strategy that transforms raw meeting transcripts into **actionable insights**—such as key decisions, action items, and summaries—helping teams reduce post-meeting effort and improve decision-making.

The case study emphasizes **user-centric product thinking, AI-enabled feature design, prioritization tradeoffs, and go-to-market strategy**, rather than technical implementation.

## Problem Statement
Modern teams spend significant time in meetings, yet meeting transcripts alone are insufficient for effective follow-up. Users struggle to:
- Identify key decisions and action items
- Summarize long discussions
- Share clear outcomes with stakeholders

This creates inefficiencies, accountability gaps, and lost insights—especially for knowledge workers and enterprise teams.

---

## Product Objective
Design an **AI-powered meeting intelligence feature** that:
- Converts meeting conversations into structured, decision-ready outputs
- Reduces manual note-taking and follow-up work
- Improves clarity, accountability, and collaboration across teams

---

## Target Users
- Knowledge workers in fast-paced environments
- Product, strategy, and operations teams
- Managers who need clear summaries and action tracking
- Enterprise users with frequent cross-functional meetings

---

## Product Approach
The strategy followed a structured product framework:

- **Jobs-to-Be-Done (JTBD):** Understand what users are trying to accomplish after meetings
- **Feature Ideation:** Explore AI-driven summaries, decision extraction, and action-item tracking
- **Prioritization:** Evaluate features using impact vs. effort and user value
- **AI Considerations:** Address trust, transparency, and responsible AI usage
- **Go-To-Market:** Define rollout and adoption strategy for enterprise users

---

## Key Product Decisions
- Prioritize **meeting summaries and action items** over full transcript accuracy
- Focus on **enterprise and power users** where meeting overload is highest
- Emphasize **AI transparency and user control** to build trust
- Position the feature as a **productivity and decision-support tool**, not just transcription

---

## Business Impact
- Reduces time spent on post-meeting follow-ups
- Improves decision clarity and accountability
- Increases product stickiness and daily active usage
- Strengthens Otter.ai’s value proposition for enterprise adoption

---

## Go-To-Market Strategy
- Launch with enterprise and team-based plans
- Highlight productivity gains and time savings in marketing
- Offer guided onboarding and in-product education
- Use usage-based metrics (summary views, action-item adoption) to measure success

---

## Key Takeaways
This case study demonstrates how **AI can be applied thoughtfully in product design**—balancing automation with user trust, and aligning technical capabilities with real user needs and business outcomes.


## About This Project
This project was completed as part of a product management course and reframed as a **standalone product strategy case study** for portfolio purposes. It reflects applied product thinking, strategic decision-making, and practical use of AI in real-world products.
